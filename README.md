# About
This is an OS made for fun. I mainly used information from the OSdev wiki to make this aswell as from https://github.com/cfenollosa/os-tutorial. I use 640x480 VGA mode with 4-bit colors, I provide multicore support for 3D rendering, provide a disk driver for an IDE controller using ATA PIO mode and I make use of an Intel 82540EM network card. Though the source code quickly became very messy, I'm am happy with the result.
